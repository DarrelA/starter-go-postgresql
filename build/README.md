# `/build`

**Purpose**:

- The `/build` directory is a central place for all packaging and continuous integration tools and scripts. It's designed to encapsulate the processes and configurations necessary for compiling the code, creating packages, and preparing the application for deployment.

**Contents**:

- Within this directory, you'll find subdirectories like `/build/package` for cloud (AMI), container (Docker), OS (deb, rpm, pkg) package configurations, and `/build/ci` for CI tools configurations and scripts (e.g., Travis CI, CircleCI, Drone). The layout is meant to separate different aspects of the build process clearly.

**Use Case**:

- Developers and CI/CD systems utilize this directory to perform automated builds, tests, and packaging. The structured subdirectories ensure that the necessary scripts and configurations are easily accessible and manageable. This setup aids in maintaining a consistent and efficient build process across various environments and platforms.

Examples:

- [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/build) demonstrates a robust `/build` structure with distinct sections for different packaging and CI/CD aspects.
