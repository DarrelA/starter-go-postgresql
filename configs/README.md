# `/configs`

**Purpose**:

- The `/configs` directory is intended to hold configuration file templates and default configurations. It's the go-to place for setting up and customizing the application's behavior in various environments.

**Contents**:

- This directory typically includes `confd` or `consul-template` template files and might be organized into subdirectories for different environments or services. The focus is on keeping all configurable aspects of the application in one easily accessible location.

**Use Case**:

- This directory is primarily used by developers setting up their local environment and automated deployment systems configuring the application for different stages (development, testing, production). By centralizing configurations, the application maintains consistency across various environments while allowing for necessary adjustments.

Examples:

- Real-world projects often have a clear `/configs` directory with environment-specific subdirectories or files, reflecting the application's flexibility and adaptability to different scenarios.
