# `/internal/service`

- **Purpose**: The service folder typically contains the core business logic of your application. It acts as a layer between the handlers (which deal with request/response) and the lower-level details of the database or external services.
- **Use Case**: Services might include things like a `UserService` for handling user-related operations or an `OrderService` for processing orders. They encapsulate the business rules and ensure that your handlers remain lean and focused solely on handling request/response cycles.
