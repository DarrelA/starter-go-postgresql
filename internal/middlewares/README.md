# `/internal/middleware`

- **Purpose**: Middleware is used for handling cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and input validation. It sits between the incoming request and the handler, often modifying or augmenting the request or response.
- **Use Case**: You might use middleware to check if a user is authenticated before allowing them to access certain routes or to log all incoming requests for monitoring and debugging.
