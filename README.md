## Model-View-Controller (MVC)

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern separates an application into three interconnected components, improving the organization and manageability of the code.

1. **Model:** Manages the data and business logic of the application.
   - DTO files are located in the `internal/domains` folder.
2. **View:** Represents the user interface and displays the data.
   - Refer to the frontend repository.
3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user input and updating the Model and View accordingly.
   - Handlers process HTTP requests and are located in `internal/handlers`.
   - Services contain business logic and are located in `internal/services`.
   - DAO files are in the `internal/domains` folder for database interactions.

## N-tier Architecture

An N-tier architecture separates each layer or tier of the application both physically and logically, which enhances flexibility and manageability.

1. **Frontend (Presentation Layer):** This is the user interface of the application. In an N-tier setup, you can update or replace the frontend without needing to alter the backend, as long as the interface contract (e.g., APIs) remains consistent.

2. **Backend (Business Logic Layer):** This layer contains the business rules and logic. You can modify or replace this layer as needed without affecting the other tiers, provided the interfaces between the layers don't change.

3. **Database (Data Access Layer):** This layer handles data storage and retrieval. You can switch out databases or change how data is accessed, and as long as you maintain the same data contracts or APIs, the other layers remain unaffected.

Benefits of N-tier architecture include:

1. **Scalability:** Each layer can be scaled independently based on its resource requirements.
2. **Flexibility:** You can replace or upgrade one layer without significant rework of the others.
3. **Maintainability:** Smaller, well-defined codebases for each layer are easier to manage and understand.

However, N-tier architecture can also introduce complexity in terms of network latency, configuration, and management. Each layer likely needs to communicate over a network, which can affect performance and add complexity that wouldn't be as prominent in a monolithic architecture.

## Combining Microservices and N-tier Architectures

Combining N-tier architecture with microservices involves separating concerns within an application while decoupling it into independently deployable services. Each microservice can adhere to N-tier principles, enhancing modularity and scalability.

#### `X-Correlation-ID` & `Request-ID`

- **`X-Correlation-ID`**
  - **Purpose:** Used to trace and correlate a series of related requests across multiple services. It helps in understanding the journey of a particular transaction or user action through the system.
  - **Scope:** Typically spans multiple services and systems. It's used to connect different parts of a transaction that might pass through various microservices.
  - **Usage:** The `X-Correlation-ID` header is included in HTTP requests and responses to maintain the correlation ID across different services.
- **`Request-ID`**
  - **Purpose:** Used to uniquely identify a single request within a service. It helps in logging and debugging individual requests.
  - **Scope:** Usually limited to a single request-response cycle within a service. It can be useful for tracking the processing of a request through different components of the same service.
  - **Usage:** The `Request-ID` header is included in HTTP requests and responses to identify the specific request.
- **Key Differences**
  - **Scope:** `X-Correlation-ID` has a broader scope, typically spanning multiple services, while `Request-ID` is more narrowly focused on a single request within a service.
  - **Usage Scenario:** Use `X-Correlation-ID` when you need to trace an end-to-end transaction through multiple microservices. Use `Request-ID` for tracking and debugging individual requests within a specific service.

## JWT

### Implementation of Refresh Token with Redis

JWTs are stateless and should not require database round trips. Redis improves token validation efficiency by reducing database queries and offers built-in expiration times for stored keys, which is ideal for managing tokens with limited lifespans. It effectively handles token revocation by invalidating tokens and preventing unauthorized access without needing additional database queries. By leveraging Redis, we achieve a seamless and secure authentication process.
